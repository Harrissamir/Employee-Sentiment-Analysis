Employee Sentiment Analysis

Problem Statement

Employee feedback is crucial for understanding workplace morale, engagement, and potential issues. However, manually analyzing large volumes of feedback from emails, surveys, and chat logs is time-consuming and inefficient. HR teams need an automated system to analyze sentiment, categorize feedback, and generate insights for better decision-making.

Solution

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) with VADER Sentiment Analysis to process employee feedback. The system:

Collects Employee Feedback – Gathers input from various sources such as surveys and chat logs.

Preprocesses Text – Cleans and tokenizes the feedback for analysis.

Performs Sentiment Analysis – Uses VADER to assign sentiment scores (Positive, Neutral, or Negative).

Visualizes Insights – Displays sentiment distribution using Seaborn for easy interpretation.

Automates Reporting – Helps HR teams track trends and take proactive measures.

Technologies Used

Python

NLTK (VADER Sentiment Analysis)

Pandas (Data Handling)

Seaborn & Matplotlib (Visualization)

How to Run

Install required dependencies:

pip install pandas nltk matplotlib seaborn

Ensure vader_lexicon is downloaded:

import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

Run the script to analyze sentiment and visualize results.

Expected Output

A categorized dataset showing employee sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative).

A bar chart visualizing sentiment distribution for HR insights.

Future Enhancements

Integrate real-time data from emails, chat platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).

Use deep learning models (BERT) for more advanced sentiment classification.

Implement a dashboard for real-time sentiment monitoring.
